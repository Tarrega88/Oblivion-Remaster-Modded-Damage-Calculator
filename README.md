- Update: I am nearing completion on a user friendly version of this calculator, which I have in another repo: https://github.com/Tarrega88/oblivion-remaster-difficulty-calculator  

This repo will be left unchanged since it's just a quick download and might be easier for some people to play with.  
All future updates will be made to the other repo.  
  
End update -

To use:  
Download files into a folder.  
Open index.html with a web browser of your choice.  
(Or, if you want to adjust filters first, open up difficultyCalc.js with your preferred IDE or text editor and change the filter object)  
You'll be prompted whether you want to use the filters or not.  
You'll then be prompted on whether you'd like to download the csv file or just view the table on the page.
